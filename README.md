# Secret Santa in Fe

## Instructions

1. Install [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
2. Install [Fe](https://fe-lang.org/)

You can build the project with:

```shell
fe build
```

This repository has Foundry installed, this allowed me to create more complex
tests (Fe tests are kind of limited) and deploy mock contracts.

Running the tests will compile the Fe contract for you:

```shell
forge test
```
